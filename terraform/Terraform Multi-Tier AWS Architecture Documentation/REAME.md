Terraform Multi-Tier AWS Architecture Documentation

This project is designed to deploy a scalable, secure, and highly available multi-tier application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform. The architecture is modular, making it easy to manage, extend, and reuse components. Below is a comprehensive explanation of the project structure, modules, configuration, usage, and best practices.

1. Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the deployment of a typical web application stack on AWS. The stack includes:

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation.

Public and private subnets in each Availability Zone (AZ) for different application tiers.

Internet and NAT gateways to enable secure inbound and outbound traffic.

Security groups to control access to each tier.

Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and Launch Templates for frontend (web) and backend (app) servers.

Application Load Balancers (ALB) to distribute traffic to web and app servers.

RDS database for data storage, placed in private subnets for security.

This setup ensures high availability, scalability, and security for your application.

2. Project Structure

The project is organized into a root directory and several module directories. Each module is responsible for a specific part of the infrastructure.

    ├── alb/               # Application Load Balancers
    └── rds/               # RDS database
Each module contains its own main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf files.

3. Module Descriptions

VPC Module:

Creates a VPC with a specified CIDR block.

Creates public subnets for the web tier, private subnets for the app tier, and private subnets for the database tier, all in each specified Availability Zone.

Outputs the VPC ID and subnet IDs for use by other modules.

Networking Module:

Creates an Internet Gateway and attaches it to the VPC.

Creates Elastic IPs and NAT Gateways in each public subnet.

Creates route tables for public and private subnets.

Associates subnets with the appropriate route tables.

Outputs gateway and route table IDs.

Security Module:

Creates security groups for the web, app, and database tiers.

Web security group allows HTTP/HTTPS from anywhere.

App security group allows traffic from the web security group.

Database security group allows traffic from the app security group.

Outputs security group IDs.

Compute Module:

Creates launch templates for web and app servers.

Creates Auto Scaling Groups for web and app servers, placing them in the appropriate subnets.

Creates target groups for the ALBs.

Outputs target group ARNs for ALB configuration.

ALB Module:

Creates a public ALB for the web tier and a private ALB for the app tier.

Configures HTTP and HTTPS listeners (HTTPS requires a certificate).

Associates target groups with the ALBs.

Outputs ALB DNS names and ARNs.

RDS Module:

Creates a subnet group for the database.

Provisions an RDS instance in the private database subnets.

Configures the database engine, version, credentials, and storage.

Outputs the RDS endpoint and username.

4. Configuration Files

main.tf:

Calls all the modules in the correct order.

Passes required variables between modules.

Coordinates the dependencies (e.g., VPC ID, subnet IDs, security group IDs).

variables.tf:

Declares all input variables for the root module.

Includes defaults for region, VPC CIDR, AZ count, instance type, etc.

Handles sensitive variables like the database password.

outputs.tf:

Exports key outputs such as VPC ID, subnet IDs, ALB DNS names, and RDS endpoint.

Marks sensitive outputs to protect them in logs.

terraform.tfvars:

Sets variable values for the deployment (region, CIDR, AMI, key name, etc.).

Can be used for sensitive values, but environment variables are recommended for production.

providers.tf:

Configures the AWS provider and required Terraform version.

Can include backend configuration for remote state storage.

5. Usage Instructions

Initialize the Project:
Run terraform init to download required providers and modules.

Set Required Variables:

Edit terraform.tfvars for most settings.

For sensitive values like the database password, use environment variables:

text
export TF_VAR_db_password="your-strong-password"
Or set it in terraform.tfvars (not recommended for production secrets).

Plan the Deployment:
Run terraform plan to review the changes that will be made.

Apply the Configuration:
Run terraform apply to create the infrastructure. Confirm the changes when prompted.

Review Outputs:

After apply, Terraform will display outputs such as ALB DNS names and the RDS endpoint.

Sensitive outputs like the RDS endpoint and username are masked.

6. Best Practices

Modularity:

Each component is a separate module, making the code reusable and easy to maintain.

Sensitive Data:

Use environment variables or secrets management for passwords and other sensitive data.

State Management:

Store Terraform state securely, preferably in a remote backend like S3.

Security:

Place databases in private subnets and restrict access using security groups.

Tagging:

Consistently tag all resources for cost tracking and operational management.

7. Example Outputs

After deployment, Terraform will output information such as:

text
web_alb_dns_name = "web-alb-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
app_alb_dns_name = "app-alb-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
rds_endpoint = <sensitive>
These outputs can be used to access your application and database.

8. Troubleshooting

Missing Variables:

If Terraform prompts for a variable (e.g., db_password), ensure it is declared in variables.tf and set in terraform.tfvars or as an environment variable.

Module Errors:

Check that all required arguments are passed to each module in main.tf.

Provider Errors:

Ensure the AWS provider is configured with the correct region and credentials.

9. Summary

This Terraform project provides a robust, modular, and secure foundation for deploying a multi-tier application on AWS. It automates the creation of all necessary infrastructure components, including networking, security, compute, load balancing, and database resources. By following the provided structure and best practices, you can easily manage, scale, and secure your application environment.
